# Thunderwriter

Demo: https://thunderwriter.surge.sh/

I want to start writing fiction regularly.  Since I'm using React for
Brighthike, I thought it would be fun to use React to shape the app in which I
write.  I'll add (and probably subtract?) features as I go along.  However,
here's a first minimum.  Thunderwrite

* Maintains a running word count.
* Saves your work in the browser as you type so you don't lose words on refresh.
* Changes collor when you reach your word count goal.
